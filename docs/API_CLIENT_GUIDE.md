# Relay API Client Guide

This guide covers day-to-day use of the Relay browser workbench and desktop app.

Start the browser workbench from a collection directory:

```sh
relay ui my-collection
```

Relay binds to localhost and prints the URL, usually `http://127.0.0.1:7717`. The desktop app opens the same workbench through `relay-app --workspace my-collection`.

## 1. Workspace And Storage

Relay uses two storage layers:

- Plain files: request collections for CLI and git workflows.
- SQLite: workbench state, history, settings, presets, environments, and Test Management data.

When the workbench opens a directory that contains `.req.toml` files and the database is empty, it seeds the database from the files. The CLI still runs directly from files with `relay run`.

## 2. Collections And Requests

Open the Collections view to create and organize API requests.

Common actions:

- Create a collection from the side pane add button.
- Create folders inside a collection.
- Create requests at collection or folder level.
- Open collection or folder settings to edit inherited headers and variables.
- Move requests between folders from request actions.
- Send a request from the editor.
- Run a request, folder, or collection with the selected environment.

Each request editor supports method, URL, query params, headers, auth, body, variables, assertions, and scripts.

## 3. Environments And Variables

Relay placeholders use this syntax:

```text
{{variableName}}
```

Use placeholders in URLs, query params, headers, auth fields, bodies, assertions, and scripts.

Variable resolution order is:

1. Request variables
2. Folder variables
3. Collection variables
4. Selected environment variables and secrets

Computed variables are also available:

```text
{{$uuid}}
{{$timestamp}}
{{$isoTimestamp}}
{{$randomInt}}
```

To configure an environment in the UI:

1. Open Environments.
2. Create or select an environment such as `local`, `sit`, or `uat`.
3. Add variables like `baseUrl` or `customerId`.
4. Add secret names like `apiToken`.
5. Set matching process variables before starting Relay, for example `RELAY_SECRET_APITOKEN`.

Secrets are resolved from the process environment. They are masked in relevant UI output and should not be committed to collection files.

## 4. Header Presets

Header Presets are reusable header sets that can be attached to collections and folders.

Use them for repeated headers such as:

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `X-Correlation-Id: {{$uuid}}`
- API gateway client identifiers
- Shared auth headers when they are not better represented by request auth

Preset values marked as secret are stored locally in the workbench database, masked in the UI, and excluded or protected during export paths that support secret handling.

## 5. Request Bodies And Auth

Supported auth helpers:

- Bearer token
- Basic auth
- API key in header or query

Supported body types:

- JSON
- XML
- Raw text
- URL encoded form
- Multipart form data
- Binary file

Use variables freely in body content and auth fields.

## 6. Assertions

Assertions run after the response is received. Add them from the request editor or Test Management editor.

Supported assertion types:

| Type | Example |
|---|---|
| Status | status equals `200` |
| JSONPath | `$.result.status` equals `VERIFIED` |
| Header | `Content-Type` contains `application/json` |
| Contains | body contains `success` |
| Max ms | total duration is under `2000` ms |

Keep at least one status assertion on important requests, then add body or header assertions for business behavior.

## 7. Scripts

Relay supports pre-request scripts and post-response test scripts through a sandboxed JavaScript runtime.

Pre-request example:

```js
pm.environment.set("requestId", "req-" + Date.now());
```

Test script examples:

```js
pm.test("Status is 200", function () {
  pm.expect(pm.response.code).to.equal(200);
});

pm.test("Body includes success", function () {
  pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include("success");
});

pm.test("Capture token", function () {
  var body = pm.response.json();
  pm.environment.set("token", body.token);
});
```

Implemented Postman-style APIs include `pm.test`, `pm.expect`, `pm.environment`, `pm.collectionVariables`, `pm.variables`, `pm.response`, and `console` methods. Scripts do not have filesystem or network access.

## 8. Send And Run Workflow

For a single request:

1. Select the environment from the toolbar.
2. Edit the request fields.
3. Save the request.
4. Click Send.
5. Review response body, headers, timing, assertions, and script test results.

For a wider run:

1. Use run actions for a request, folder, or collection.
2. Relay executes matching requests with the selected environment.
3. Review pass/fail counts, failed assertion messages, and timing.

CLI equivalent:

```sh
relay run my-collection --env sit --report junit --out relay-results.xml
```

## 9. Import And Export

The workbench can import Postman collection JSON, OpenAPI JSON, and pasted curl commands.

The CLI can import the same sources:

```sh
relay import postman collection.json --out my-collection
relay import openapi openapi.json --out my-api
relay import curl 'curl https://api.example.com/health'
```

The workbench and CLI can export Postman collection JSON, OpenAPI JSON, curl, k6, and Playwright API tests.

CLI examples:

```sh
relay export postman my-collection --out collection.json
relay export openapi my-collection --out openapi.json
relay export curl my-collection/health.req.toml --env sit
relay export k6 my-collection --env sit --out load.js
relay export playwright my-collection --env sit --out api.spec.ts
```

## 10. History And Stats

The History view stores sent requests and responses locally in `relay.db`. Use it to inspect previous responses and replay recent behavior. Request stats show recent timing data for a request.

## 11. Test Management

Open Test Management from the left rail.

Current capabilities:

- Default test cases are created from existing requests.
- A request can have multiple UI test cases.
- Tests can be enabled or disabled.
- Tests can have tags, owner, priority, Xray key, requirement keys, and test plan key.
- Tests can override the request assertions and test script.
- Tests can be organized into test folders and test sets.
- You can run one test, selected tests, a folder, a collection, or a test set from the UI.
- Last run results show assertion and script-test steps.

Important current-state detail: Test Management data is stored in the SQLite workspace database. The CLI runs assertions and scripts stored in `.req.toml` request files; it does not yet run the separate UI test-case records or support `--select` / Xray push flags.

## 12. Xray Cloud

Open Settings, then configure Xray Cloud:

- Project key
- Optional test plan key
- Optional Cloud GraphQL URL override
- Optional auth URL override
- Default labels and component

Credentials can be provided through environment variables before starting Relay:

```sh
export RELAY_XRAY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export RELAY_XRAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

The UI also has a credentials save action that stores credentials in the local `relay.db`. Prefer environment variables for shared or CI-like usage.

From Test Management you can validate an existing Xray test key, create an Xray test, link requirement keys, create an Xray test set, and push selected test runs to Xray as a test execution.

Headless Xray push from `relay run` is planned but not implemented in the current CLI.

## 13. Troubleshooting

Variables not resolving:

- Confirm the intended environment is selected.
- Confirm the variable exists in request, folder, collection, or environment scope.
- For secrets, confirm the `RELAY_SECRET_*` variable was set before Relay started.

Scripts not showing test results:

- Put assertions inside `pm.test` blocks in the Tests script.
- Save the request or test, then send or run again.
- Check for runtime errors in the response/test output.

CLI and UI disagree:

- The CLI runs from `.req.toml` files.
- The workbench runs from `relay.db` after seeding/import.
- Export or recreate files when you need file-based CLI runs to reflect UI-only edits.

Xray push fails:

- Confirm project key is set.
- Confirm credentials are present from environment variables or local UI credentials.
- Validate individual Xray test keys before pushing a larger run.
- Ensure selected tests are enabled.
