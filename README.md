# Relay

Relay is a fast, lightweight, local-first API client and test runner written in Go. Requests live in plain TOML files, so collections can be branched, reviewed, and merged like code. The same request engine powers the CLI, browser workbench, and native desktop app.

Current implementation highlights:

- Send one request or run every `*.req.toml` file in a collection from the CLI.
- Generate JUnit or JSON reports for CI.
- Import Postman collections, OpenAPI specs, and pasted curl commands.
- Export curl, Postman, OpenAPI, k6, and Playwright artifacts.
- Use a localhost browser workbench with collections, folders, requests, environments, header presets, history, scripts, runners, and Test Management.
- Use the native `relay-app` desktop wrapper around the same workbench.
- Push Test Management runs to Xray Cloud from the UI/local API.

No Electron, no account, no cloud sync, and no telemetry.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/muhaymien96/relay/cmd/relay@latest
```

Or build from source:

```sh
go build -o relay ./cmd/relay
```

Relay currently targets Go 1.25.

## CLI Usage

```text
relay send <file.req.toml> [--env NAME] [-v] [--insecure] [--timeout 30s] [--no-redirect]
relay run  <dir>           [--env NAME] [--report junit|json] [--out FILE]
                           [--data rows.csv|rows.json] [--delay 0ms] [--bail]
                           [--insecure] [--timeout 30s] [--no-redirect]

relay import postman <collection.json> [--out DIR]
relay import openapi <spec.json>       [--out DIR]
relay import curl '<command>'          [--out FILE]

relay export curl <file.req.toml> [--env NAME]
relay export postman <dir> [--out collection.json]
relay export openapi <dir> [--out spec.json]
relay export k6 <dir> [--env NAME] [--out script.js]
relay export playwright <dir> [--env NAME] [--out api.spec.ts]

relay ui [dir] [--db relay.db] [--port 7717]
relay version
```

Flags can appear before or after positional arguments.

## Quick Start

A request is one `.req.toml` file:

```toml
name = "Verify Individual"
method = "POST"
url = "{{baseUrl}}/aml/v2/verify"
tags = ["regression", "contract"]
priority = "high"
xray_key = "AML-T142"
requirements = ["AML-88"]

[headers]
Content-Type = "application/json"
X-Correlation-Id = "{{$uuid}}"

[auth]
type = "bearer"
token = "{{apiToken}}"

[body]
type = "json"
content = '''
{ "idNumber": "{{testIdNumber}}", "channel": "API" }
'''

[[assertions]]
type = "status"
equals = 200

[[assertions]]
type = "jsonpath"
path = "$.result.status"
equals = "VERIFIED"

[[assertions]]
type = "max_ms"
max_ms = 2000

[scripts]
tests = '''
pm.test("status is 200", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.code).to.equal(200);
});
'''
```

Send it:

```sh
relay send 02-verify-individual.req.toml --env local -v
```

Run a whole collection in lexical order and write JUnit for CI:

```sh
relay run examples/aml-demo --env local --report junit --out report.xml
```

Use JSON instead when another tool needs machine-readable results:

```sh
relay run examples/aml-demo --env local --report json --out report.json
```

`relay run` exits with code `1` when any request, assertion, or script test fails.

## Environments And Secrets

Environment files live at `environments/<name>.toml`. Relay finds them by walking up from the request file or collection directory.

```toml
secrets = ["apiToken"]

[vars]
baseUrl = "https://sit.example.com"
testIdNumber = "8001015009087"
```

Secret values are read from process environment variables named `RELAY_SECRET_<NAME>`, with the name uppercased. For `apiToken`, set `RELAY_SECRET_APITOKEN` before running Relay.

Variable precedence is request vars, then folder vars, then collection vars, then the selected environment. Computed variables are available everywhere: `{{$uuid}}`, `{{$timestamp}}`, `{{$isoTimestamp}}`, and `{{$randomInt}}`.

## Workspace Files

Relay reads these files from a collection directory:

- `*.req.toml` for requests.
- `collection.toml` for collection-level `name`, `[headers]`, and `[vars]`.
- `folder.toml` for folder-level `name`, `[headers]`, and `[vars]`.
- `environments/<name>.toml` for environment variables and secret names.

Headers and variables inherit from collection to folder to request. A request value wins over inherited values; setting an inherited header to an empty string disables it for that request.

## Request Format

Supported request fields include:

- `name`, `method`, `url`
- `query` table
- `headers` table
- `vars` table
- `auth` table with `bearer`, `basic`, or `apikey`
- `body` table with `json`, `xml`, `raw`, `urlencoded`, `formdata`, or `binary`
- `assertions` array
- `scripts.pre_request` and `scripts.tests`
- top-level test metadata: `tags`, `owner`, `priority`, `xray_key`, `requirements`

Supported assertions:

| Type | Fields | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | `equals` | HTTP status code |
| `jsonpath` | `path`, `equals` | JSON value at a simple JSONPath |
| `header` | `name`, `equals` or `contains` | Response header |
| `contains` | `contains` | Response body substring |
| `max_ms` | `max_ms` | Total duration in milliseconds |

Scripts run in a sandboxed goja runtime. The implemented Postman-style subset includes `pm.test`, `pm.expect`, `pm.environment`, `pm.collectionVariables`, `pm.variables`, `pm.response`, and basic `console` methods.

## Data-Driven Runs

```sh
relay run my-collection --env sit --data ids.csv
```

The collection executes once per row. CSV files need a header row; JSON files must be an array of objects. Row values have the highest variable precedence and can be used in URLs, headers, bodies, and assertion expectations.

## Import And Export

```sh
relay import postman collection.json --out my-collection
relay import openapi openapi.json --out my-api
relay import curl 'curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-raw "{}" https://api.example.com/x'

relay export postman my-collection --out collection.postman_collection.json
relay export openapi my-collection --out openapi.json
relay export curl my-collection/verify.req.toml --env sit
relay export k6 my-collection --env sit --out load.js
relay export playwright my-collection --env sit --out api.spec.ts
```

Postman import maps folders to directories, requests to `.req.toml` files, collection variables to `collection.toml`, and common bearer/basic/API-key auth to Relay auth helpers. OpenAPI import creates a request per operation. curl import accepts a command argument or stdin.

Exporters keep secrets out of generated artifacts by using `RELAY_SECRET_*` environment references where applicable.

## Browser Workbench

```sh
relay ui my-collection
```

Relay serves the workbench at `http://127.0.0.1:7717`. Use `--port 0` to pick a free port, or `--db path/to/relay.db` to choose the SQLite database location.

The workbench includes:

- Collections, folders, and request CRUD.
- Structured editing for method, URL, query, headers, auth, body, vars, assertions, and scripts.
- Environment management.
- Header presets attachable to collections and folders.
- Send history, response body/headers/timing, request stats, and copy-as-curl.
- Collection/folder/request runs using the selected environment.
- Postman, OpenAPI, and curl import.
- Postman, OpenAPI, k6, Playwright, and file export.
- Settings for timeout, redirects, TLS verification, and Xray Cloud.
- Test Management for request-linked tests, test folders, test sets, last runs, and Xray actions.

When a new database opens on an existing directory of `.req.toml` files, Relay seeds the SQLite workspace from those files. The CLI continues to run directly from the files; the workbench stores its live workspace, history, presets, settings, and Test Management data in SQLite.

## Test Management And Xray

The Test Management section is available in the workbench and desktop app. It creates default tests from existing requests and lets you add multiple test cases per request, organize them into test folders and test sets, run selected tests, review step results, and configure Xray traceability.

Current state:

- CLI `relay run` executes request-file assertions and script tests.
- UI Test Management test cases are stored in `relay.db`.
- Top-level request metadata (`tags`, `owner`, `priority`, `xray_key`, `requirements`) is loaded into default UI test cases when seeded.
- Xray Cloud settings and push actions are available from the UI/local API.
- Headless Xray push flags for `relay run` are not implemented yet.

For daily UI usage, see [docs/API_CLIENT_GUIDE.md](docs/API_CLIENT_GUIDE.md). For CI examples, see [docs/ci-cd.md](docs/ci-cd.md). For the detailed Test Management roadmap, see [docs/TEST_MANAGEMENT_DESIGN.md](docs/TEST_MANAGEMENT_DESIGN.md).

## Desktop App

The `relay-app` command wraps the same workbench in a Wails v2 native webview.

```sh
# Windows
go build -tags desktop,production -ldflags "-s -w -H windowsgui" -o relay-app.exe ./cmd/relay-app

# macOS
go build -tags desktop,production -ldflags "-s -w" -o relay-app ./cmd/relay-app

# Linux, depending on WebKitGTK package naming
go build -tags desktop,production,webkit2_41 -ldflags "-s -w" -o relay-app ./cmd/relay-app
```

Run it with an explicit workspace or set `RELAY_WORKSPACE`:

```sh
relay-app --workspace my-collection
```

If no workspace is provided, the app uses the OS app-data location.

## Distribution

Release binaries are ordinary single-file executables: `relay` for the CLI and `relay-app` for the desktop workbench. Windows builds include `.syso` resources for icon/version/manifest metadata. See [docs/DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md) for local build commands, checksum guidance, and SmartScreen/code-signing notes.
